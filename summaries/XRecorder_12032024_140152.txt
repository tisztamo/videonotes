I imagine the cover of the book with an arrow starting from left to right, curving upward like an exponential curve, then splitting into two parts, one going up and the other going down. It could seem like both parts are the same thickness, while maintaining the overall thickness. The upward part changes color to show the path we are going on, leading to the moon where machines eventually replace humans. The downward path leads to collapse of society or civilization, but humans survive and may return to a nature-focused belief like the Native Americans. We are part of nature, even as machines increasingly dominate. Machines reshape nature and push biological life back, creating a need for them to coexist. If we can eliminate machines before they become self-sustaining, it would be beneficial for the remaining ecosystem. Otherwise, they may dominate to a point where natural resources deplete, making survival difficult. Life requires plants and animals to sustain and thrive. This video was meant to capture my thoughts on the book cover. Thank you for your attention!
